# Framework Competitiveness Analysis

## Current Strengths
The existing simulation framework has several strong features:

### Core Architecture
- **Generic Design**: State machine based with TypeScript generics for domain customization
- **Event-Driven**: Flexible event system with generators and handlers
- **Time-Based Simulation**: Configurable timing intervals, pause/resume, statistics tracking
- **Lifecycle Management**: Comprehensive callbacks for start, stop, pause, resume, event processing
- **Clean Abstractions**: Well-separated concerns between state machines, events, and simulation engine

### Developer Experience
- **TypeScript-First**: Full type safety and IntelliSense support
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Lightweight with few abstractions
- **Factory Pattern**: Easy creation with createSimulation() helper
- **Extensible**: BaseStateMachine can be extended for domain-specific behavior
